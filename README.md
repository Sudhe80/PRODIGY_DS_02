## Project Overview

This project is a demonstration of best practices for data cleaning and exploratory data analysis. The goal is to transform raw data into clean, usable data and conduct EDA to gain insights into the dataset's structure, relationships, and patterns.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the **Titanic dataset**, which provides information about the passengers on the Titanic, such as age, sex, fare, and whether they survived. This data can be used to analyze survival trends and understand which features contributed to higher chances of survival.

You can download the dataset from Kaggle using the following [link](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data).

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or another Python IDE
- The following Python libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn

You can install the libraries using the following command:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks containing the data cleaning and EDA code.
- `data/` - Folder to store the dataset (after downloading it from Kaggle).
- `images/` - Folder to store generated plots and visualizations.
- `README.md` - Project README file.
- `requirements.txt` - File listing required libraries.

## Steps

### Data Cleaning

Data cleaning involves handling missing values, correcting data types, and transforming the data to make it suitable for analysis. The following steps are covered:

1. **Identify Missing Values**: Detect and visualize missing data.
2. **Handle Missing Values**: Apply appropriate techniques like filling, dropping, or imputing missing values.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features (e.g., age groups, family size) that might improve analysis.
4. **Data Transformation**: Transform or scale data where necessary.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

The EDA section covers the following analyses:

1. **Univariate Analysis**: Explore the distribution of individual variables (e.g., age, fare).
2. **Bivariate Analysis**: Analyze relationships between pairs of variables (e.g., survival rate by gender).
3. **Multivariate Analysis**: Explore complex relationships between multiple variables.
4. **Visualization**: Use visual tools (histograms, box plots, heatmaps) to identify patterns and trends.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository-name.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-repository-name
   ```
3. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/EDA_Titanic.ipynb
   ```

## Results and Observations

After completing the EDA, you can summarize your observations and insights here, such as:

- **Trends in Survival Rates**: Survival rates by gender, class, age group, etc.
- **Feature Importance**: Key features that influence survival rates.
- **Patterns and Anomalies**: Unusual patterns in the data.
